This folder contains my solutions of the problems I have solved in Codewars. (www.codewars.com)

Everything I enter in this folder consists of each and every problems I have solved, separated by each folder labeled by their kyus(same as levels) and problem names. Each problem folder consists of ideas, thought processes, and my final solution code with the source code file. I will write down everything I was thinking when solving this problem.
